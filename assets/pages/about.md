<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>

Hi! I am Shreyas Ramachandran, a material scientist and engineer specializing in Computational Materials Science. Throughout the years I've worked on various classes of materials using modelling techniques across the quantum mechanical, classical and continuum length scales. A recurring theme in my projects is energy efficiency in storage and conversion, among others. I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Condensed Matter Physics at the University of Edinburgh, working on magnetism in 2D materials.

<h4> Biography </h4>

I started my journey as a mechanical engineer at Birla Institute for Technology and Science (BITS) Hyderabad where I first discovered the rich field of Materials Science. Starting with an experimental approach, I worked with <a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/sujith-r/" target="_blank">Prof. Sujith R</a> in collaboration with <a href="https://hbl.in/" target="_blank">HBL Power Systems Ltd</a> on Lithium-Ion Batteries, where I developed silicon oxycarbide- (SiOC) and nano silicon-based materials as potential anode materials. A summer internship at the <a href="https://aerb.gov.in/english/about-us/safety-research-institute" target="_blank">Safety Research Institue - Atomic Energy Regulatory Board</a> introduced me to computational modelling using numerical techniques in the continuum limit. Subsequently, I pursued computational projects in materials science that led to several publications on hydrogen storage using 2D materials. I completed my undergraduate thesis in collaboration with <a href="https://www.mawi.tu-darmstadt.de/mm/home_mm/index.en.jsp" target="_blank">Prof. Karsten Albe at TU Darmstadt</a> where I modelled the interface between Lithium anodes and Lithium-Lanthanum-Zirconium-Oxide (LLZO) electrolytes using Kinetic Monte Carlo. After my undergraduate degree, I continued as a research assistant with Prof Albe where I studied solid solutions of Lithium and Sodium Niobates using DFT. In 2022, I enrolled in the MSc Advanced Materials Science and Engineering at Imperial College London and graduated with Distinction. In my MSc dissertation, supervised by <a href="https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/j.lischner" target="_blank">Prof. Johannes Lischner</a>, I modelled the interaction of plasmonic gold-silver alloy nanoparticles with light and the subsequent hot electron-hole distribution generated. After the MSc, I started my PhD in Condensed Matter Physics at the University of Edinburgh, supervised by <a href="https://www.ph.ed.ac.uk/people/elton-santos" target="_blank">Dr Elton Santos</a>. Currently, I study magnetism in 2D materials using a mixture of quantum mechanical and semi-classical atomistic simulations. My projects range from anti-ferromagnets for spintronic devices to layered heterostructures for multi-state memory devices.
