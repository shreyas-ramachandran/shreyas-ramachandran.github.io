My research focuses on developing new materials and technologies for energy storage and conversion. I am particularly interested in 2D materials and heterostructures, which have unique properties that make them promising candidates for a wide range of applications. I use a combination of experimental and computational techniques to study the structure, properties, and performance of these materials. My work aims to advance our understanding of 2D materials and their potential for use in electrochemical devices such as batteries, supercapacitors, and fuel cells.

Some of my recent projects include:

- Investigating the electrochemical properties of 2D materials
- Developing new synthesis methods for 2D materials and heterostructures
- Characterizing the structure and properties of 2D materials using advanced microscopy techniques
- Modeling the electronic and ionic transport in 2D materials and devices

My research has the potential to impact a wide range of fields, from energy storage and conversion to electronics and optoelectronics. I am excited to be part of the growing community of researchers working on 2D materials and to contribute to the development of new technologies that can address the challenges of the 21st century.
